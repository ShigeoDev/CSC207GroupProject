# Summary of Project:
The project we decided on, is a recipe based application that includes features that provide the user with information
regarding recipes. At first, we were thinking about what kind of application would help us in our day-to-day lives, and 
we ultimately decided on creating an application that speeds up the process of deciding what to eat. In order to do this,
we are utilizing an API that contains information on countless recipes. We then created methods that take the information 
provided by the API and return the result the User wants to see. Some problems we want to solve can be shown through our 
individual and group user stories.
### User Stories
(Kevin) A person wants to create an account that keeps track of recipes they save. This account has a username and 
password, and an empty list for saved recipes.

(Brad) A person wants to check the number of calories a certain recipe contains. He then runs the program to get the number 
of calories given the name of the recipe.

(Jingduo) A person who gets cold recently wants to eat meal with more vitamin C. He checks the app to search for which 
food has high vitamin C to help him get better quickly.

(Rui) A person wants to search the recipes for salads. They run the program and enter salads. Then, the output is all 
the recipes of salads.

(Nigel) A user wants to store recipes so that they can access it later.

(Group) User wants to figure out what to eat for three meals in a day. User can click a button to generate a meal plan for that day. 

### Image of Project View
This is our initial Project View. Without any coding, we decided on what we wanted our application to look like, as well
as the methods we wanted to implement.
